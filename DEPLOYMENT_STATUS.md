# Deployment Status - Thunder Text

## Current Status: ✅ Ready for Deployment

### Environment Variables: ✅ Configured
All required environment variables are now set on Render:
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_API_KEY`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- ✅ All other required variables

### Code Fixes: ✅ Pushed to Main
Latest commit: `ba8d1c3` - "fix: add environment variable validation to token exchange endpoint"

**Fixes included:**
1. ✅ Authentication - authenticatedFetch for all API calls
2. ✅ Build failure - lazy Supabase initialization
3. ✅ Category API - correct table reference
4. ✅ Token exchange - environment validation and error logging

### Next Steps: Deploy

**Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deploy** (Recommended)
Render should automatically deploy when it detects the new commit on `main` branch.
- Typical time: 2-5 minutes to trigger
- Build time: 2-3 minutes

**Option 2: Manual Deploy**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select: Thunder Text service
3. Click: **Manual Deploy** button
4. Select: **Deploy latest commit**

### After Deployment - Expected Results

✅ **Working Features:**
- AI description generation from images
- Category auto-detection
- Color variant detection
- Template selection
- Token exchange and authentication
- Product creation in Shopify

❌ **Known Issues (Non-Critical):**
- Sizing API returns 401 (custom_sizing table doesn't exist - optional feature)
- Template dropdown may be empty (prompts table may need seeding)

### Testing Checklist

After deployment completes:
1. ✅ Open Thunder Text in Shopify admin
2. ✅ Upload product image
3. ✅ Click "Generate Description"
4. ✅ Verify generated content appears
5. ✅ Click "Create Product in Shopify"
6. ✅ Confirm product created successfully

### Troubleshooting

If issues persist after deployment:
1. Check Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com/srv-d2s9mi24d50c73dkctpg/logs
2. Look for: "❌ Missing Supabase configuration"
3. If found, redeploy may not have picked up env vars - try manual deploy
4. Check browser console for detailed error messages
