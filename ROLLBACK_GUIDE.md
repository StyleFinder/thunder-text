## 🚨 How to Rollback

### If Future Changes Break Something:

#### Option 1: Quick Rollback (Recommended)
```bash
# Save current work if needed
git stash push -m "save current changes before rollback"

# Switch to rollback point
git checkout feature/shopify-extension-rollback-point

# Create new branch from rollback point
git checkout -b feature/rollback-recovery-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Continue development from known working state
```

#### Option 2: Cherry-pick Specific Fixes
```bash
# If only some changes are problematic
git checkout feature/shopify-extension-rollback-point
git checkout -b feature/selective-recovery
git cherry-pick <good-commit-hash>  # Apply only good changes
```

#### Option 3: Complete Reset
```bash
# Nuclear option - completely reset to rollback point
git checkout feature/shopify-admin-extension
git reset --hard origin/feature/shopify-extension-rollback-point
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/shopify-admin-extension
```

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### To Verify Rollback Point Works:
```bash
# Switch to rollback branch
git checkout feature/shopify-extension-rollback-point

# Start development servers
./start-dev.sh

# Test extension
# 1. Navigate to product in Shopify admin
# 2. Click "More actions" → "Thunder Text AI"
# 3. Verify template loading and generation works
```

### To Check What Changed:
```bash
# Compare current branch with rollback point
git diff feature/shopify-extension-rollback-point..HEAD

# See commit history since rollback point
git log feature/shopify-extension-rollback-point..HEAD --oneline
```

## 🎯 Recovery Strategy

### If Extension Stops Working:
1. **Quick Test**: Switch to rollback branch and verify it still works
2. **Identify Issue**: Compare differences between working and broken states
3. **Selective Fix**: Cherry-pick only the necessary fixes
4. **Full Rollback**: If needed, reset completely to rollback point

### If Database Issues:
- Rollback point includes working API endpoints
- Template loading queries are preserved
- Database schema expectations documented

### If API Changes Break Extension:
- Rollback point preserves working API integration
- Extension authentication patterns preserved
- Shopify API calls documented and working

## 📝 Notes

- **GitHub Backup**: Both branches pushed to GitHub for remote backup
- **Development Servers**: Should work immediately after rollback
- **Database State**: Rollback assumes current database schema
- **Extension Registration**: Shopify extension registration preserved

## 🚀 Continue Development Safely

After creating this rollback point, you can:
- ✅ Experiment with new features confidently
- ✅ Make breaking changes without fear
