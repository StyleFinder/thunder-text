## Implementation Notes

**Code Reuse Strategy:**
- Maximize reuse of existing components (CategoryTemplateSelector, DropZone)
- Extend existing utility functions rather than duplicating
- Maintain consistency with current UI patterns and styling
- Leverage existing API patterns and error handling

**Performance Considerations:**
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical product data
- Cache product images and metadata locally where appropriate
- Use progressive enhancement for form field population
- Optimize for mobile and slow network conditions

**Security & Compliance:**
- Ensure all Shopify API calls use proper authentication
- Validate product access permissions before enhancement
- Handle sensitive product data according to privacy requirements
- Implement audit logging for enhancement operations

This comprehensive plan provides a systematic approach to implementing the "Enhance Existing Product" feature while maintaining code quality, user experience standards, and integration consistency with the existing Thunder Text application.
