# Token Exchange Issue - Current Status

**Date**: October 9, 2025, 1:05 PM UTC
**Current Deploy ID**: dep-d3jr5qk9c44c73c3qvg0 (building)

## Problem Summary

Token exchange endpoint (`/api/shopify/token-exchange`) returns 500 errors, preventing:
- Access tokens from being stored in database
- Product creation (fails with 401 authentication required)
- All other API calls that require authentication

## Root Cause Analysis

**Client-side behavior (from console logs):**
```
layout-99f2e57a87988d05.js:1 üîÑ Exchanging session token for access token...
thunder-text.onrender.com/api/shopify/token-exchange:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
layout-99f2e57a87988d05.js:1 üì• Token exchange response status: 500
layout-99f2e57a87988d05.js:1 ‚ùå Token exchange failed
```

**What we know:**
1. ‚úÖ Session token is being obtained from Shopify App Bridge
2. ‚úÖ Client is correctly calling `/api/shopify/token-exchange` with session token and shop
3. ‚ùå Server returns 500 error (internal server error)
4. ‚ùå No access token stored in database
5. ‚ùå All subsequent API calls fail with 401

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Error Logging (Commit: 63e23f9)
Added detailed server-side logging to token exchange endpoint:
- Request validation with token lengths and shop domains
- Environment variable verification
- Shopify API request/response logging
- Supabase storage logging
- Database error details
- All logs tagged with `[TOKEN-EXCHANGE]` prefix

### 2. Runtime Error Fixes (Commit: b27e330)
Fixed critical bugs in product creation endpoint:
- Line 201: `store.shop_domain` ‚Üí `shopDomain`
- Line 471: `store.shop_domain` ‚Üí `shopDomain`
- Removed references to undefined `session` and `supabaseAdmin` variables

These would have caused crashes AFTER token exchange worked.

## Deployment Status

**Previous Deployment** (dep-d3jr3f7fte5s7381548g):
- Status: Live
- Deployed: 13:03 UTC
- Code: Comprehensive logging (commit 63e23f9)

**Current Deployment** (dep-d3jr5qk9c44c73c3qvg0):
- Status: Building
- Code: Runtime error fixes (commit b27e330)
- Will include both logging AND bug fixes

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Once Deployment Completes):
1. **Test the app** - Try to create a product description
2. **Retrieve server logs** using:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d3jgbii4d50c73f6biog/logs?limit=100" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer rnd_6hTqU8nqmxQ2aoYv1oH1IREXqTkm" | \
     grep "\[TOKEN-EXCHANGE\]"
   ```
3. **Analyze the detailed error logs** to identify exact failure point

### Expected Log Output:
The new logging will show:
- `üîÑ [TOKEN-EXCHANGE] Starting token exchange process`
- `üì• [TOKEN-EXCHANGE] Request body: {...}`
- `üîë [TOKEN-EXCHANGE] Environment variables check: {...}`
- `üì§ [TOKEN-EXCHANGE] Sending token exchange request to Shopify: {...}`
- `üì® [TOKEN-EXCHANGE] Shopify API response: {...}`
- Either:
  - `‚úÖ [TOKEN-EXCHANGE] Token exchange successful: {...}`
  - `‚ùå [TOKEN-EXCHANGE] Token exchange failed: {...}` ‚Üê This will show WHY

### Possible Root Causes We'll See:

1. **Environment Variable Issues:**
   - Missing `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`
   - Wrong `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_API_KEY`
   - Supabase credentials incorrect

2. **Shopify API Issues:**
   - Invalid session token format
   - Wrong shop domain
   - API credentials mismatch
   - Scope/permissions issues

3. **Database Issues:**
   - Can't connect to Supabase
   - RLS policy blocking writes
   - Table schema mismatch

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/api/shopify/token-exchange/route.ts` - Enhanced logging
2. `/src/app/api/shopify/products/create/route.ts` - Fixed runtime errors + enhanced logging

## Testing Instructions

Once deployment completes:
1. Go to Thunder Text app in Shopify admin
2. Upload a product image
3. Click "Generate Description"
4. **Open browser console** (F12) and check for errors
5. **The server logs will now show exactly what's failing**

## Key Console Logs to Watch For:

**Client-side (browser console):**
- `üîÑ Exchanging session token for access token...`
- `üì• Token exchange response status: 500` ‚Üê This is the problem
- `‚ùå Token exchange failed: {error details}`

**Server-side (Render logs):**
- Look for `[TOKEN-EXCHANGE]` tagged messages
- Look for `‚ùå` error markers
- Error details will be in structured JSON format

## Environment Variables to Verify

Make sure these are set on Render:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_API_KEY` - Client ID (public)
- `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` - Client secret (private)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` - Supabase service role key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anon key
