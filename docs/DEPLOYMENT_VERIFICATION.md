## Known Issues / Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Database Connection
**Problem**: SQLite doesn't work on Vercel serverless
**Solution**: Must use PostgreSQL

**Options**:
1. **Vercel Postgres** (Recommended):
   - Go to Vercel project → Storage → Create Database
   - Select Postgres
   - Vercel auto-configures `DATABASE_URL`

2. **Supabase Postgres**:
   - Use existing Supabase project
   - Get connection string from Supabase dashboard
   - Format: `postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.upkmmwvbspgeanotzknk.supabase.co:5432/postgres`

3. **External Provider** (Railway, Neon, etc.):
   - Set up PostgreSQL instance
   - Add connection string to Vercel env vars

**Status**: ⚠️ Requires action

---

### Issue 2: Prisma Migrations
**Problem**: Migrations need to run on first deploy
**Solution**: Build command includes `npm run setup` which runs migrations

**Verify**:
- Check Vercel build logs for "Prisma migrate deploy"
- Should see: "✓ Applied migrations successfully"

**Status**: ⏳ Pending verification

---

### Issue 3: Shopify Webhook Registration
**Problem**: Webhooks need to be registered after first deploy
**Solution**: Shopify package auto-registers on first request

**Verify**:
- After first app install, check Shopify Partners → Webhooks
- Should see: `app/uninstalled`, `app/scopes_update`

**Status**: ⏳ Pending first install

---

## Shopify App Configuration

### Updated Settings

**App URL**: `https://[your-vercel-url].vercel.app`

**Allowed Redirection URLs**:
- `https://[your-vercel-url].vercel.app/auth/callback`
- `https://[your-vercel-url].vercel.app/auth/shopify/callback`
- `https://[your-vercel-url].vercel.app/auth/login`

**App Proxy** (if needed): Not configured yet

## Performance Benchmarks

Once deployed, verify performance:

### Expected Metrics

| Metric | Next.js (Old) | React Router 7 (Target) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Cold Start | 2-3s | 1-2s |
| Page Load (Products) | 1.5s | <1s |
| Authentication | Often fails | Always works |
| Build Time | 45-60s | 30-45s |

### How to Measure

1. **Lighthouse Score**: Run in Chrome DevTools
2. **Vercel Analytics**: Check dashboard after deployment
3. **User Testing**: Real Shopify store installation

---

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails or has critical issues:

### Option 1: Revert to Next.js (Temporary)
1. Point Shopify app URL back to Next.js deployment
2. Investigate issues in React Router 7
3. Fix and redeploy

### Option 2: Fix Forward (Preferred)
1. Check Vercel logs for errors
2. Fix environment variables
3. Trigger redeploy
4. Test again

### Option 3: Rollback Git Commit
```bash
cd /Users/bigdaddy/prod_desc/thunder-text-v2
git revert HEAD
git push
# Vercel auto-redeploys
```
