# RLS Implementation - Baseline Test Results

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Branch:** `feature/rls-security-policies`
**Status:** Pre-RLS Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **Baseline Established** - Application is in working state before RLS implementation

**Key Findings:**

- Type checking: ✅ PASS
- Existing tests: ✅ PASS
- Ready to proceed with RLS implementation

---

## Test Results

### 1. Git Branch Setup ✅

```bash
Current Branch: feature/rls-security-policies
Parent Branch: main-typescript
Status: Clean working directory
```

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Feature branch created successfully

---

### 2. TypeScript Type Checking ✅

**Command:** `npm run type-check`

**Result:** ✅ PASS - No TypeScript errors

```
> thunder-text@0.1.0 type-check
> tsc --noEmit

[No output = success]
```

**Conclusion:** Type system is sound before RLS changes

---

### 3. Existing Test Suite ✅

**Command:** `npm run test`

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Tests running successfully

**Tests Found:**

- `src/__tests__/lib/openai.test.ts` - AI generation tests

**Test Status:** PASS

**Notes:**

- Some expected console errors from database mocking (normal)
- Tests validate OpenAI integration works
- No RLS-related tests yet (will be added)

---

### 4. Application Build Status

**Status:** Not tested yet (will test after RLS implementation)

**Reason:** Build process not required for RLS migration testing

---

## Current Database State

### RLS Status: DISABLED ⚠️

**Evidence:**

```sql
-- From migration: 015_disable_rls_temporarily.sql
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE stores DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- etc.
```

**Security Risk:** ⚠️ HIGH

- Any authenticated user can access any store's data
- Multi-tenancy isolation not enforced
- Production deployment BLOCKED until fixed

---

## Tables Requiring RLS

Based on schema review:

1. ✅ **users** - User accounts
2. ✅ **stores** - Store information
3. ✅ **content** - Generated content
4. ✅ **samples** - Content samples
5. ✅ **voice_profiles** - Voice/tone profiles
6. ✅ **category_templates** - Product category templates
7. ✅ **shop_sizes** - Store sizing data
8. ⚠️ **system_prompts** - Global prompts (may not need RLS)
9. ⚠️ **integrations** - OAuth tokens (needs encryption + RLS)

---

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [x] Feature branch created
- [x] Testing strategy documented
- [x] Baseline tests run
- [x] Type checking passes
- [x] Existing tests pass
- [x] Tables identified for RLS
- [ ] Database backup created (TODO before migration)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented (In RLS_TESTING_STRATEGY.md)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Implementation)

1. **Create Database Backup**

   ```bash
   # If using Supabase CLI
   supabase db dump -f backup-before-rls-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

   # Or via pg_dump
   pg_dump DATABASE_URL > backup-before-rls.sql
   ```

2. **Review Table Schemas**

   ```bash
   # Get current schema
   supabase db diff > schema-before-rls.sql
   ```

3. **Verify Test Users Exist**
   - store1@test.com (for testing)
   - store2@test.com (for cross-store tests)

### Implementation Phase

4. **Create RLS Migration**
   - File: `supabase/migrations/020_enable_rls_policies.sql`
   - Enable RLS on all tables
   - Create policies for:
     - Users can view/edit own records
     - Store-based data filtering
     - Global template access

5. **Create RLS Tests**
   - File: `src/__tests__/security/rls-integration.test.ts`
   - Test own data access
   - Test cross-store blocking
   - Test CRUD operations
   - Test global templates

6. **Apply Migration Locally**

   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

7. **Run Full Test Suite**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run type-check
   # Manual testing in browser
   ```

### Validation Phase

8. **Verify RLS Working**
   - Try to access other store's data → Should fail
   - Verify own data accessible → Should work
   - Check API routes → Should respect RLS

9. **Performance Check**
   - Query times should be <1 second
   - No N+1 query issues

10. **Security Validation**
    - SQL injection attempts blocked
    - JWT tampering detected
    - All policies enforce isolation

---

## Expected Behavior After RLS

### ✅ Should Work

- User login and authentication
- Accessing own store's data
- Creating/editing own content
- Viewing global templates
- API routes with valid tokens
- Subdomain routing

### ❌ Should Fail (Security Working)

- Accessing other store's data
- Modifying other store's records
- API calls with wrong store token
- Direct database queries without JWT
- Tampered JWT tokens

---

## Rollback Triggers

**Implement rollback if:**

- Migration fails to apply
- App doesn't start after migration
- Users can't access their own data
- Performance degrades significantly (>5s queries)
- Type checking fails
- > 50% of tests fail

**Rollback Process:**

```bash
# Option 1: Revert migration
supabase db reset

# Option 2: Manual disable
ALTER TABLE table_name DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

# Option 3: Restore from backup
psql < backup-before-rls.sql

# Option 4: Abandon branch
git checkout main-typescript
git branch -D feature/rls-security-policies
```
