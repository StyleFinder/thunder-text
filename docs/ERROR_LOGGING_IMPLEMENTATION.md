# Enhanced Error Logging Implementation

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Deploy ID**: dep-d3jqvdi4d50c73fe9oo0
**Status**: Deploying

## Problem Statement

Product creation was failing with the following errors:
- Token exchange endpoint returning 500 errors
- Product creation returning 401 authentication errors
- Limited visibility into the failure points

## Solution: Comprehensive Server-Side Logging

### Token Exchange Endpoint (`/api/shopify/token-exchange`)

Added detailed logging at every step:

1. **Request Validation**
   - Session token length and preview
   - Shop domain (both formats)
   - Timestamp tracking

2. **Environment Variable Verification**
   - Check for all Shopify API credentials
   - Check for all Supabase configuration
   - Log credential lengths and prefixes (not full values)
   - List all available SHOPIFY/SUPABASE env vars

3. **Shopify API Communication**
   - Request URL and method
   - Client ID and secret verification
   - Grant type and token types
   - Response status and headers
   - Full error text from Shopify

4. **Database Storage**
   - Supabase connection details
   - Which key is being used (service vs anon)
   - Upsert operation details
   - Full database error messages with codes

5. **Success Confirmation**
   - Access token received (length and preview)
   - Scope granted
   - Storage confirmation

### Product Creation Endpoint (`/api/shopify/products/create`)

Enhanced authentication logging:

1. **Request Initialization**
   - Shop parameter from query
   - Request URL
   - Timestamp

2. **Token Retrieval**
   - Database query for access token
   - Token retrieval success/failure
   - Access token length
   - Error messages from token manager

3. **Authentication Failure Details**
   - Full error context including shop domain
   - Token error messages
   - Debug information in response

## Log Message Format

All logs are tagged with prefixes for easy filtering:
- `[TOKEN-EXCHANGE]` - Token exchange endpoint logs
- `[PRODUCT-CREATE]` - Product creation endpoint logs

Emojis for quick visual scanning:
- üîÑ - Process starting
- üì• - Request received
- üîë - Authentication/credentials
- üì§ - Sending request
- üì® - Response received
- üíæ - Database operations
- ‚úÖ - Success
- ‚ùå - Error

## Expected Outcomes

With these logs, we can now diagnose:

1. **Environment Configuration Issues**
   - Are all required env vars present?
   - Are they the correct length?
   - Which Supabase key is being used?

2. **Token Exchange Failures**
   - What exact error is Shopify returning?
   - Are the credentials correct?
   - Is the session token valid?
   - Are response headers providing clues?

3. **Database Storage Issues**
   - Can we connect to Supabase?
   - Are there RLS policy issues?
   - Are there table schema issues?

4. **Authentication Flow**
   - Is the token exchange completing?
   - Is the token being stored?
   - Is the token retrieval working?

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for deployment to complete** (~5-10 minutes)
2. **Reproduce the error** by attempting to create a product
3. **Retrieve Render logs** filtered for:
   - `[TOKEN-EXCHANGE]`
   - `[PRODUCT-CREATE]`
   - Any `‚ùå` error markers
4. **Analyze the logs** to identify exact failure point
5. **Implement targeted fix** based on log findings

## Log Retrieval Commands

```bash
# Get all logs
curl -s "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d3jgbii4d50c73f6biog/logs?limit=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rnd_6hTqU8nqmxQ2aoYv1oH1IREXqTkm"

# Filter for token exchange logs (using grep after curl)
curl -s "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d3jgbii4d50c73f6biog/logs?limit=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rnd_6hTqU8nqmxQ2aoYv1oH1IREXqTkm" | \
  grep "TOKEN-EXCHANGE"

# Filter for product creation logs
curl -s "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d3jgbii4d50c73f6biog/logs?limit=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rnd_6hTqU8nqmxQ2aoYv1oH1IREXqTkm" | \
  grep "PRODUCT-CREATE"

# Filter for errors only
curl -s "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d3jgbii4d50c73f6biog/logs?limit=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rnd_6hTqU8nqmxQ2aoYv1oH1IREXqTkm" | \
  grep "‚ùå"
```
