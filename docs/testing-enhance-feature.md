# Testing the Enhance Product Feature

## Test URLs

### 1. Product Selection Page (No Product ID)
```
https://thunder-text-nine.vercel.app/enhance?shop=zunosai-staging-test-store&authenticated=true
```
- Should show product grid with mock products
- Click "Enhance Description" on any product

### 2. Direct Product Enhancement (With Mock Product ID)
```
https://thunder-text-nine.vercel.app/enhance?shop=zunosai-staging-test-store&authenticated=true&productId=8123456789
```
- Should load product data directly
- Should show enhancement workflow

### 3. Alternative Mock Product IDs
```
# Product 1
https://thunder-text-nine.vercel.app/enhance?shop=zunosai-staging-test-store&authenticated=true&productId=8123456790

# Product 2
https://thunder-text-nine.vercel.app/enhance?shop=zunosai-staging-test-store&authenticated=true&productId=8123456791
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Product Selection**: Shows grid of available products
2. **Product Loading**: Fetches product data (mock in dev mode)
3. **Context Review**: Shows product overview and AI suggestions
4. **Configuration**: Form to configure enhancement settings
5. **Generation**: AI generates enhanced description
6. **Comparison**: Side-by-side view of original vs enhanced
7. **Apply**: Updates product in Shopify (mock in dev mode)

## Debugging

Check browser console (F12) for:
- `ðŸ”„ Fetching product data for enhancement`
- `ðŸ§ª Development mode: returning mock product data`
- `âœ… Product data loaded successfully`

## Common Issues

1. **"No product data returned"**
   - Check if product ID is being passed correctly
   - Verify auth bypass is enabled in development
   - Check console for error logs

2. **Page doesn't load**
   - Verify Vercel deployment is complete
   - Check network tab for failed requests
   - Ensure cookies/session are valid

3. **Mock data not appearing**
   - Verify SHOPIFY_AUTH_BYPASS=true in environment
   - Check if product ID format is correct
   - Review console logs for mock mode detection
