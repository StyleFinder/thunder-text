**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Implementation**:
- Added `ProgressBar` import from `@shopify/polaris`
- Implemented progress state management with `useState` and `useRef`
- Created smooth 0-90% animation during AI generation (2-10% increments every 800ms)
- Completes at 100% when API generation succeeds
- Proper cleanup in success/error/unmount scenarios

**Code Location**: `/Users/bigdaddy/prod_desc/thunder-text/src/app/create/page.tsx`  
**Lines Modified**: 22 (import), 70-82 (state/cleanup), 508-523 (animation), 561-595 (completion), 1221-1223 (UI)

### 2. Form Field Accessibility Fix ✅
**Requirement**: Fix disabled form fields in "Features & Additional Details" section  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Implementation**:
- Removed `disabled` constraint from "Key Features" field
- Removed `disabled` constraint from "Additional Notes" field
- Fields are now always enabled regardless of image upload status
- Improved form consistency across all sections

**Code Location**: `/Users/bigdaddy/prod_desc/thunder-text/src/app/create/page.tsx`  
**Lines Modified**: 1159-1176 (Features & Additional Details section)
